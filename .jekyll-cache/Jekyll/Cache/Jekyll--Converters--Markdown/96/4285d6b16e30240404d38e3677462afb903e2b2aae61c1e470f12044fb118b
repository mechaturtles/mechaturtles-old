The Great Navel Orange race is a competition where first-year engineering students must build a boat or submarine to traverse a fountain.</p>

<p>My team decided to build a â€œsubmarineâ€ or, more precisely, an underwater roverâ€“to simplify the control system.</p>

<h3 id="design">Design</h3>
<p>The control system was extremely simple. No programming was required at all.</p>

<p>We originally wanted to 3D print our chassis but the design failed and we only had a week and a half left. I decided to repurpose an Orlando Hospital mug and 3D print parts to attach to the final design.</p>
